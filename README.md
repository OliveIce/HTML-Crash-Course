## Intro 

HTML is the foundation of all web pages. It defines the structure of a page, while CSS defines its style. HTML and CSS are the beginning of everything you need to know to make your first web page! Learn both and start creating amazing websites.

## How to use

1. You will need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). There are many popular IDE environments for programming. I use Visual Studio Code. If you use Windows, you can follow the instructions on how to install VS Code in your laptop or PC [on this link.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nh9rCzPJ20). Or if you use a Mac, [you can follow this link instead.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06I63_p-2A4).

2. Download this repo as a zip file and unzip it.

3. E-portfolio Evidence: Just focus on following the step-by-step of the course. Then, write a short 500-1000 word reflection on the course, what you learned, if you managed to do all the tasks, how was it, if you didn’t, why? And this, accompanied by screenshots of your work.
